Simple Online Judge system written in PHP, using PostgreSQL.

This repository is missing the "images" and "problems" directories.

The "problems" directory should be automatically created after the first problem is 
created, if not, you will have to manually create it and give ownership to the same 
user/group that's running the HTTP server (http:http for Apache on Arch Linux).
